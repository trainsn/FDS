	The code file named "wbg2015_G04_N6.c" is supposed to implement the O(N^6) versions of algorithms for finding
the maximum submatrix sum while which named "wbg2015_G04_N4.c" is to implement the O(N^4) versions.What's more,he code
file named "wbg2015_G04_bonus.c" is a better algorithm.As we can see in the program, the complexity is O(n^3).
	Thus,the proper order for reader to browse is "wbg2015_G04_N6.c"->"wbg2015_G04_N4.c" -> "wbg2015_G04_bonus.c"
